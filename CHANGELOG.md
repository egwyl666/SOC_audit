# Changelog

## [1.2] — 2026-09-25

Driven by the v1.1 test run on a domain controller (64- and 32-bit). Status: parser check and unit tests passed;
**Windows re-run pending**.

### Fixed
- `pfirewall.log` was parsed and copied twice when firewall profiles spelled the path with different case
  (`system32` / `System32`) — ALLOW/DROP counters and per-source totals were doubled. Paths are now de-duplicated
  case-insensitively.
- Bare executable names in task actions and command lines (`sc.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `BthUdTask.exe`) were
  classified as "non-standard path" → false High flags on built-in `\Microsoft\` tasks (regression from 1.1) and on
  third-party tasks. New `Resolve-BareExe` resolves them via System32 / Windows / wbem / WindowsPowerShell / SysWOW64.
- Firewall rules whose program is `System` (kernel) were flagged "program in non-standard path" (69 false flags on DC).
- Microsoft-signed binaries in `C:\Windows\<subfolder>` (ADWS, AzureArcSetup…) are no longer flagged for location;
  unsigned files there (e.g. `C:\Windows\KMSAutoS`) still are.
- Locked sources (active `pfirewall.log`, History of a running browser) got `COPY-ONLY`: the hash before/after is now
  computed via a shared-read stream, so copies are verified or reported as `SOURCE_CHANGED`.

### Changed
- 4624 is queried in two parts with separate limits — interactive/RDP (2/7/10/11) and network (3) — and service SIDs
  (S-1-5-18/19/20/7) are excluded in XPath, so network logons on a DC no longer push RDP/interactive logons out of the sample.
- 32-bit PowerShell on 64-bit Windows: when started with `-File`, the script re-launches itself in 64-bit PowerShell
  (`Sysnative`) with the same parameters (the test showed WOW64 distortions: empty `Winlogon\Userinit`,
  "missing" `lsass.exe`). Otherwise it warns as before.
- Step 1.1 captures `netstat -ano` first (`01_volatile\netstat_ano.txt`) and records the time of each source in custody.
- Host role (workstation / DC / server) is recorded; on a DC, SMB/RPC from internal addresses without drops is no longer
  a pfirewall.log heuristic hit. RDP/WinRM/SSH and SMB/RPC are now separate heuristics.

## [1.1] — 2026-09-25

Status: parser check (PowerShell 7.4) and unit tests of the changed functions passed; **a full run on Windows / PS 5.1 is still pending**.

### Added
- Pre-launch environment check, before anything is written to disk: `#Requires -Version 5.1` plus a runtime check
  (PS < 5.1, pwsh on non-Windows, non-`FullLanguage` mode → clear message and exit code `2`;
  32-bit PowerShell on 64-bit OS and old WMF 5.1 builds → warning, recorded in collection notes).
- SQLite sidecar files (`-wal`, `-journal`, `-shm`) are copied next to browser / Windows Timeline databases with the same
  prefix and verified hashes; `-wal`/`-journal` are also searched for hints.

### Changed
- Order of volatility (NIST SP 800-86 5.1.2): new step 1.1 takes a fast raw snapshot (TCP/UDP → processes);
  owner/hash/signature enrichment runs afterwards on that snapshot. Steps 1.x renumbered (1.1–1.6).
- Scheduled tasks under `\Microsoft\*` are no longer skipped wholesale: a task is kept when its action is in a
  user/non-standard path, has IOC/suspicious arguments, or runs an interpreter (powershell, cmd, mshta, rundll32…)
  with a non-Microsoft author. TaskScheduler events under `\Microsoft\*` are kept when registered/changed by a
  real user account or when the action is suspicious. Flagged as "Маскування під \Microsoft\" (High).
- Event log sampling cut by `-MaxEvents` now states from which time events were kept, and the flag is Medium (was Info).
- `Get-StringHints` reads databases in 4 MB chunks with overlap instead of loading the whole file into memory.

### Fixed
- IOC IPs were matched as substrings (`10.3.0.20` matched `110.3.0.201` and `10.3.0.200`). Text search now respects
  address boundaries; exact comparisons normalise brackets and IPv6 zone ids.
- `-ExcludeDirs 'a,b'` via `-File` was not split, because `OutRoot` was appended before `Split-ListParam`.
- `-OutRoot E:\` added `\` to exclusions and silently disabled the wide search; now only the case folder is excluded.
- PowerShell 4104: script blocks that are the collector's own code (same path or a fragment of its text) are skipped
  and counted in collection notes, instead of raising false "suspicious script block" flags.
- `.gitattributes` restored (it was committed as `gitattributes.txt` and had no effect).
- Duplicate `$Keywords` computation removed.

## [1.0]
- Initial version: tested on Windows 11 / PowerShell 5.1.26100, 34/34 steps OK.
